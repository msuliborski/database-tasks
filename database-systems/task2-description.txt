1. Create a database named LIBRARY (as shown at schema on the next page). Give names to all the constraints (except NULL constraints). The properties of the tables are defined as follows:

    MEMEBERS table

       CardNo - 5 characters, primary key,

       Surname -  up to 15 characters,

       Name – as above,

       Address –up to 150 characters,

       Name, Surname, Birthday_date – not null,

       Gender - 1 char: M or F letter,

       Phone_No – up to 15 characters.

    Employees table

       emp_id - primery key with identity set (seed = 1, incerement=1) ,

       Surname, Name and Birthday_date are not null,

       birthday date must be earlier than date of employment (Emp_Date),

    Publishers table

       pub_id is a primary key with identity set (seed=1, incerement=1),

       Name, City, - not null, up to 50 characters,

       Phone_No - up to 15 charakters,

    Books table

       BookID - primary key, 5 characters,

       Pub_ID - foreign key related to Publishers,

       Type - charaters, must contain one of the following values: novel, historical, for kids, poems, crime story, science fiction, science

       Price is a currency field (money), not null,

       Title - up to 40 characters, not null,

    BOOK_LOANS table

       LoanID  - integer with identity set (seed = 1, increment = 1), primary key,

       CardNo, BookID and emp_id are foreign keys related to Members, Books and Employees,

       DateOut must be earlier than DueDate,

       Penalty can't contain negative values, default is set to 0 (zero),

 

 

2. Create database diagram and check it corectness (compare with a diagram above).

3. Add data from the script (library_eng_data.sql). In case of errors, check the defined structure again..

4. There is Gender field in Employees table omitted (it should contain 'F' or "M' value). Correct this mistake.

5. Change Book_loans tabel - add another constraint, that enforces uniqueness of  a pair of values : BookID and DateOut. 


Additional practice

Create a database according to the following diagram and requirements. Populate database using video_popul.sql script. In case of errors, correct the structure.
